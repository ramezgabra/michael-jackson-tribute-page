            <p>She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene</p>
            <p>I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one</p>
            <p>Who will dance on the floor in the round?</p>
            <p>She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round</p>
            <p>She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene</p>
            <p>Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one</p>
            <p>Who will dance on the floor in the round</p>
            <p>People always told me be careful of what you do</p>
            <p>And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts</p>
            <p>And mother always told me be careful of who you love</p>
            <p>And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth</p>
            <p>Billie Jean is not my lover</p>
            <p>She's just a girl who claims that I am the one</p>
            <p>But the kid is not my son</p>
            <p>She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son</p>
            <p>For forty days and forty</p>
